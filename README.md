## Introduction

*TaintStream* is a cell-level taint tracking framework for big data platforms, e.g., Spark. TaintStream achieves taint tracking through two phases, i.e., **static code rewriting** and **dynamic code translation**.

In the static code rewriting phase, after taking a script as the input, *TaintStream* wraps the data processing piplines (e.g., select, filter, and groupBy) with a translation function Î¦. The function will tranlate the code to properly maintain the taint tags of each data cell.

In the dynamic code translation phase, the original code will be translated to add the effect of taint propagation. Below is a simple example. 

```python
# given a dataframe with the following schema
# name | age 
# given a script processing this dataframe
df = df.filter("age" > 18)

# -----> code after static code rewriting
context = getContext()
code = "df.filter('age' > 18)"
df = phi(code, context) # translation function

# -----> code after dynamic code translation
# Note that during the execution, each data cell is attached with a taint tag.
# So the new schema of df_tag is
# |      name     |      age      |
# | value |  tag  | value |  tag  |
df_tag = df.filter(df_tag["age"]["value"] > 18)
```

## Build and Test

Get TaintStream and run an end-to-end example.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/PKU-Chengxu/TaintStream.git
cd TaintStream
pip install -r requirements.txt
python taint_stream.py -wd ./example -i ExtractDocuments.py -t Author
```

Run paper experiments.

```
cd benchmark
python run.py
```
